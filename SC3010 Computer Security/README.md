# SC3010 Computer Security Project

## Group Project: Mirai Botnet & Emotet Trojan Analysis

- Conducted an in-depth study of two major malware families: Mirai (IoT-based botnet) and Emotet (banking Trojan)
- Analyzed their attack lifecycles including initial access, execution, lateral movement, command-and-control communication, and impact on real-world organizations
- Investigated vulnerabilities exploited (e.g., weak IoT credentials, CVE-2021-43890 Windows AppX Installer spoofing) and demonstrated malware infection workflows via network topology simulation and Wireshark analysis
- Performed source code analysis to identify techniques such as reflection/amplification attacks, process injection, and macro-based payload delivery.
- Derived security best practices including strong authentication, network segmentation, disabling macros, and enhanced phishing detection
- Explored the role of AI and machine learning in vulnerability management, including anomaly detection, automated patching, and risk assessment
