# SC3010 Computer Security Project

## Group Project: Mirai Botnet & Emotet Trojan Analysis

- Researched the attack lifecycle of Mirai (IoT botnet) and Emotet (banking Trojan), including infection, command-and-control, and impact
- Conducted network simulation and source code analysis to demonstrate vulnerabilities such as weak credentials and malicious macros
- Evaluated real-world incidents and extracted key defensive strategies (e.g., stronger authentication, network segmentation, phishing countermeasures)
- Explored applications of AI/ML in cybersecurity, including anomaly detection and automated vulnerability management
